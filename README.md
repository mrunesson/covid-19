# Covid-19/Corona data from Stockholm county

Data was stopped added at Oct 31 2021 since there are many good sources
and no major changes in Stockholm.

I wanted to understand what is happening in Stockholm county in Sweden regarding Covid-19.
In media and from the officials they say Stockholm is ahead rest of Sweden on the curve.
So for me working with data every day, though not medical data, I want to see
how Stockholm county behaves compared to Sweden as a whole.

Stockholm county(Region Stockholm) presents data including:

* number of identified cases
* number of tested people
* number of new death
* number of people in hospital for COVID-19
* number of people in hospital for COVID-19 needing care at ICU, IVA in Swedish.

Initial data was on a daily basis. But now are numbers too low and the region have stopped
reporting daily values. Therefore a weekly data set is added. It starts from early june.

Unfortunatly they are not presented in a way suitable for reading by a program used for
analysis.

To be able to understand trends etc I need to have time series. I have collected the data
from Stockholm county official media reports. You can find links for each data point in
the dataset. My goal is to regularly update with new data while it is ongoing.

I have identified a few discirptances in the numbers in the reporting that make the numbers
not add upp correctly. There has also been changes in strategy and timewindow used for reporting
over time. You can finde notes in the data about these.

It is important to know that there are delays in the data, especially in reports on death.
The table includes both the accumulated and a calculated daily value. It is in respect to
previous day's data. It does not mean that number died that day.
The number of tests taken is apparently a rounded value.

Please let me know if you find any issues with the data.
