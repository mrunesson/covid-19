# Corona data and Covid-19

I wanted to understand what is happening in Stockholm county in Sweden regarding Covid-19.
In media and from the officials they say Stockholm is ahead rest of Sweden on the curve.
So for me working with data every day, though not medical data, I want to see
how Stockholm county behaves compared to Sweden as a whole. 

Stockholm county(Region Stockholm) presents data including:
* number of identified cases
* number of death
* muber of people in hospital for COVID-19
* number of people in hospital for COVID-19 needing advanced health care, IVA in Swedish.

Unfortunatly they are not presented in a way suitable for analysis.

To be able to understand trends etc I need to have time series. I have collected the data 
from Stockholm county official media reports. You can find links for each data point in
the dataset. My goal is to regularly update with new data while it is ongoing.

I have identified a few discirptances in the numbers in the reporting that make the numbers
not add upp correctly. There has also been changes in strategy and timewindow used for reporting
over time. You can finde notes in the data about these.

Please let me know if you find any issues with the data.
